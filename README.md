# Sorting-Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. 
I used html,javascript to build this sorting visualizer. 
It beautifully demonstrates how different types of sorting techniques are implemented behind the scenes.
Online link to view the sorting visualiser and  try the sorting techniques.
